# TechtravSprint
3-4 day sprint to demonstrate ability to learn and apply PHP, Laravel Framework, and Blade templates to small project.

I am planning to create a small version of the Capstone recipe web application Reci-matic. This application will use PHP Laravel Framework with Blade templates, and the user will be able to make a call to the Tasty API to search for recipes using the search bar with user input. The selected recipe will be displayed, and the relevant information will be saved to a 'recipe book'. I will try to consume the API on the Laravel side. Below are the USER STORIES. 

1. As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes using a search bar with user input so that I can easily find the recipe that I want.
2. As a user, I want to be able to see the relevant information about the selected recipe so that I can determine if it meets my needs.
3. As a user, I want to be able to save the pertinent information about the recipe to a ‘recipe book’ so that I can easily access it later.
4. As a developer, I want to integrate the Tasty API on the Laravel side so that users can make calls to the API without any issues.
5. As a reviewer, I want to be able to access the GIT repository link provided by Nathan so that I can review the project and provide feedback.
